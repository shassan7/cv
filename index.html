        <p>I am a Software Engineering student at the university of lakehead. I
          continue to increase my knowledge on different programming applications and
          technologies during my free time. I believe my knowledge in both the
          construction industry and eagerness to learn in the software industry will
          allow me to gain experience and become an asset to the team. </p>
